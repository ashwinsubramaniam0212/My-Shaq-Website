  <pre>Since March 8, 1990, Womenâ€™s Day has been observed by SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) comprising seven countries namely India, <>Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. </pre>
  <p>The day is celebrated to highlight the problems of the girl child in these countries.<br> It is very sad that girl children are subjected to extreme neglect and disrespect, especially in underdeveloped countries. The birth of a girl child is seen by parents as a cause of pity. They are deprived of proper nutrition, education, economic opportunities and social status or respect. We must eliminate these prejudices and provide a bright future for girls by  educating them.
